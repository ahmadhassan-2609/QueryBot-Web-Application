# **QueryBot Web Application üåêü§ñ**

Powered by Flask + React + OpenAI

QueryBot is a web application designed for the e-learning company CodeBasics (website: [codebasics.io](https://codebasics.io/)). CodeBasics offers data-related courses and bootcamps and serves thousands of learners who utilize Discord servers and emails to ask questions. This system provides a web-based user interface for students to ask questions and receive answers.

## **Project Highlights**

- **LLM-based Q&A System:** Reduces the workload of human staff by providing automated responses to students' queries.
- **RAG Implementation:** Retrieves data from a CSV file of FAQs used by the company staff to provide responses.
- **Contextual Memory:** Remembers the context of past conversations to maintain continuity.
- **Full-Stack Application:** Combines a Flask backend with a React frontend for a seamless user experience.

## **Learning Experience**

This project was my first experience with building a full-fledged web application, where I had the opportunity to learn and implement:

- **Backend Development with Flask:** I learned how to create APIs, manage routes, and handle data.
- **Frontend Development with React:** I learned how to build interactive user interfaces and manage state.

## **Previous Implementation**

Before developing this full-fledged web application, I created an initial version of QueryBot using Streamlit. This version provided a simpler interface for students to interact with the bot. You can find the initial Streamlit-based implementation in my previous repository: https://github.com/ahmadhassan-2609/QueryBot
